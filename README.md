Generalised code to extract Wind Field (OWI) Component swaths from Sentinel-1 Ocean (OCN) L2 datasets and resample onto a consistent georeferenced grid. Resampled datasets in the form of GeoTIFF images are loaded into Xarray + Disk data object to facilitate spatiotemporal analysis of wind field variability at different locations.
